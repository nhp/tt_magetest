# Goal

The main goal is to create a test for every single page in default magento, frontend and admin.

Another objective is to write the tests configurable so one can just create a module, reset the defaults in config.xml to fit their needs and run the tests.

Furthermore it should be easy to extend to allow it to easily cover third-party modules.

# Version

The tests are based on Magento 1.9.1 CE with sample data.

# Requirements

Xtest from Code-x (https://github.com/code-x/Xtest)

Phpunit (included in Xtest)

Magento (of course)
